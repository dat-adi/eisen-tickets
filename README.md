## What the Eisen-tickets is all about.
An implementation of the famous Eisenhower Box, where the 2x2 matrix defines
the priority and the status of the task at hand.

Having two categories, Urgency and Importance mixed, enables you to get a clearer
understanding of which task to invest more time into.

## Installation
The Eisen tickets can easily be brought into your system, just by simply dowloading one of the [releases](github.com/dat-adi/eisen-tickets/releases) or by cloning the repository,
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dat-adi/eisen-tickets.git
```

## How the eisen-tickets work
The Eisen tickets works on the principle of a ticket based system, where each ticket has it's own 
information, the time it was made, the category it belongs to in the eisenhower box, along with the task and it's contents.
