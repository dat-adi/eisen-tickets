Eisen's Tickets is a software developed solely to bring out the revolutionary Eisenhower matrix to your desktop, but, facing errors trying to use the productive application might seem kind of ironical.<br>

At that time, you might feel like the application isn't really worth it, but, that's also the reason why Open Sourcing is such a huge thing.<br>
We want to improve!

You don't need to completely remaster the entire software by yourself.<br>
A simple create issue can do the trick for people who are ready to fix bugs, and helps the maintainer to pay attention to areas that require attention as well.

But, there does exist a method, or a procedure, to follow in case you wish to contribute to the ```eisen-tickets``` repository, that helps in reducing clutter,
and provides a better understanding to the maintainers as to what the change proposes, and what the problem statement, as well as solution is.

---

Here's how you can help out.
- [ ] Open up an issue, describing the problem statement, or the update that you wish to bring in.
- [ ] Fork the repository and work on the feature that you wish to add into the repository.
- [ ] With each commit, do specify what was the change that you have made.
- [ ] After you're done with it, and find that the work is at completion, send out a pull request to the main repository.
- [ ] Now, wait for the maintainers to check into it, and review it.

If you're pull request is rejected, don't feel bad about it.
The maintainers will provide a reason why, and whether you could make any changes for the pull request to be accepted.

Thank you for contributing.
